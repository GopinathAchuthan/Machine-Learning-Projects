In **Ridge Regression**, the symbol **λ (lambda)** represents the **regularization parameter**, which controls the strength of the regularization applied to the model.

### Ridge Regression Overview
Ridge regression is a linear regression technique that modifies the standard least squares objective by adding a penalty term. This penalty helps prevent overfitting by shrinking the model’s coefficients. The goal is to find a balance between minimizing the residual sum of squares (RSS) and keeping the model's coefficients small.

### Formula for Ridge Regression
The objective function in ridge regression is:

```
minimize ||Y - Xβ||² + λ||β||²
```

Where:
- `Y` is the vector of observed values (target variable).
- `X` is the matrix of feature variables.
- `β` is the vector of coefficients (weights) for the features.
- `λ` (lambda) is the regularization parameter.
- `||β||²` is the squared **L2-norm** of the coefficients, which is the sum of the squared values of `β`.

### How λ Affects the Model

- **When λ = 0:** Ridge regression becomes **ordinary least squares (OLS)** regression. There's no regularization, and the model tries to minimize the residual sum of squares (RSS) alone. This can lead to overfitting, especially when there are many features or when multicollinearity exists among the features.

- **When λ > 0:** The penalty term `λ||β||²` is added to the objective function. As λ increases:
  - The model applies stronger **regularization** and shrinks the coefficients more towards zero.
  - Large values of `λ` prevent the coefficients from becoming too large, leading to a simpler, more generalized model.
  - This reduces the risk of overfitting, especially when the model has many features or when there’s multicollinearity in the data.
  
  However, if `λ` is too large, the model may become too biased (underfitting), as the coefficients will be overly shrunk and might not capture the underlying patterns in the data.

### Intuition Behind λ in Ridge Regression
- **λ controls the trade-off** between the fit of the model (minimizing residuals) and the complexity of the model (minimizing the magnitude of the coefficients). 
- A **small λ** results in a model that closely fits the data, but with a risk of overfitting.
- A **large λ** results in a model that is less sensitive to the training data (simpler), but it may underfit if the regularization is too strong.

### Summary
In Ridge Regression, **λ** is the regularization parameter that helps:
- **Control overfitting**: By penalizing large coefficients, making the model simpler and less likely to overfit the training data.
- **Balance bias and variance**: The right value of λ allows for an optimal balance between underfitting (high bias) and overfitting (high variance). 

To find the best value of **λ**, **cross-validation** is often used to evaluate model performance for different values of λ and choose the one that provides the best generalization to unseen data.
